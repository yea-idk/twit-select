# twit-select
Choose a random person (or multiple) from a list of people, useful for giveaways.

The default number of users to select is 10, but this can be quickly changed by just opening mutuals.lua with a text editor and replacing `ppl = 10` with whatever number you need.

To run this please download a Lua interpretor and use that with mutuals.lua
